## Abstract
Wireless technologies are increasingly diversified to serve various Internet-of-things applications. Yet, our mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) are manufactured with limited types of wireless radio, making it challenging to access the data in the heterogeneous IoT devices. To address this fundamental problem, this work proposes XFi, which enables mobile devices to use commodity WiFi radio to directly and simultaneously collect data from diverse heterogeneous IoT devices. Our critical insight is that when an IoT frame collides with an ongoing WiFi transmission, its IoT data is captured by WiFi receiver and retained even after the demodulation procedures in WiFi hardware. Motivated by this observation, XFi proposes a general approach to obtain IoT data by analyzing the decoded WiFi payload. The method is fully compatible with existing commodity WiFi hardware and generally applicable to various IoT protocols.
<br>
We implement XFi on commodity devices (e.g., RTL8812au, CC2650, and SX1280). Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that XFi can collect data from 8 IoT devices in parallel with over 97% accuracy, offering reliable cross-technology data collection.
