Projects in CTC
======
I am currently working on Cross-Technology Communication (CTC), a new IoT network paradigm that provides direct interconnectivity among heterogeneous wireless technologies,
e.g, WiFi, LTE, Bluetooth, ZigBee and Lora. The ultimate goal is to <b>achieve seamless connections between heterogeneous wireless devices with only software update. </b>
My research covers both physical-layer CTC designs (e.g., signal processing and wireless communications) and various CTC applications. 
I develop CTC techniques on the commodity devices and several of them have been proved to be commercially viable in the real applications.

Past Projects
======
I developed industrial Internet-of-things in wireless embedded system. I was the team leader to implement ISA100.11a standards including hardware, software protocol stack 
and real-time scheduling algorithm.
