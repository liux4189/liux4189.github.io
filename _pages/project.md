Projects in CTC
======
I am currently working on Cross-Technology Communication (CTC), a new IoT network paradigm that provides direct interconnectivity among heterogeneous wireless technologies,
e.g, WiFi, LTE, Bluetooth, ZigBee and Lora. The ultimate goal is to achieve seamless connection between heterogeneous wireless devices with only software update.
My research covers both physical-layer CTC designs (e.g., signal processing and wireless communications) and various CTC applications. 
I develop CTC techniques on the commodity devices and several of them have been proved to be commercially viable in the real applications.
