Projects in CTC
======
I am currently working on Cross-Technology Communication (CTC), a new IoT network paradigm that provides direct interconnectivity among heterogeneous wireless technologies,
e.g, WiFi, LTE, Bluetooth, ZigBee and Lora. The ultimate goal is to <b>achieve seamless connections between heterogeneous wireless devices with only software update. </b>
My research covers both physical-layer CTC designs (e.g., signal processing and wireless communications) and various CTC applications. 
I develop CTC techniques on the commodity devices and several of them have been proved to be commercially viable in the real applications.

<b>LTE2B: Time-Domain Cross-Technology Emulation under LTE Constraints.</b> <br> 
LTE2B enables WAN/WLAN devices, e.g., LTE smartphone, WiFi access points to directly share data to low-power IoT devices, e.g., Bluetooth and ZigBee. The key intellectual merit of 
LTE2B is <i>Time-domain Emulation</i> which allows WAN/WLAN transmit to accurately produce Bluetooth and ZigBee waveform.

<b>BlueBee: a 10,000x Faster Cross-Technology Communication via PHY Emulation.</b> <br>
BlueBee is a CTC technique from Bluetooth to ZigBee. This project proposes physical-layer CTC scheme in which by carefully choosing the payload for one wireless technology, e.g., Bluetooth,
the transmitter can create legitimate waveform of another wireless technology, e.g., ZigBee. Physical-layer CTC opens the door for the communications between heterogeneous
devices with high data rates.

Past Projects 
======
I developed industrial Internet-of-things in wireless embedded system. I was the team leader to implement ISA100.11a standards including hardware, software protocol stack 
and real-time scheduling algorithm.
