Projects in Wireless Sensing
======
Beyond the communication, wireless radios can be leveraged as a sensor to preceive people and environment. My research interest lies in various emerging wireless sensing techniques (e.g., mmWave, UWB, and acoustic) and multi-modal sensor fusion among wireless and heterogeneous sensors (e.g., camera and IMU).

Projects in CTC
======
Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) is a new IoT network paradigm that provides direct interconnectivity and cooperations among heterogeneous wireless technologies (e.g, WiFi, LTE, Bluetooth, ZigBee and LoRa), achieving seamless connections between heterogeneous wireless devices with only software update. To achieve this, we address the incompatibility of PHY/MAC in heterogeneous wireless devices. My research starts from physical-layer designs using signal processing techniques to novel CTC applications. CTC is proved technically feasbile on commodity devices and  commercially viable in the real applications.

<b>WiBeacon: Expanding BLE Location-based Services via WiFi.</b> <br> 
WiBeaon repurposes billions of commodity Wi-Fi infrastructure to serve as the virtual Bluetooth beacon that provide low-cost, scalable, and easy-to-maintain location services for Bluetooth devices.

<b>XFi: Cross-technology IoT Data Collection via Commodity WiFi.</b> <br> 
With XFi, mobile devices (e.g., smartphone) can directly collect data from heterogeneous IoT devices (e.g., ZigBee and LoRa) using their WiFi interface. XFi is the first design that enables CTC from narrowband IoT radios to <i>commodity</i> WiFi.

<b>LTE2B: Time-Domain Cross-Technology Emulation under LTE Constraints.</b> <br> 
LTE2B enables WAN/WLAN devices, e.g., LTE smartphone, WiFi access points to directly share data to low-power IoT devices, e.g., Bluetooth and ZigBee. The key intellectual merit of 
LTE2B is <i>Time-domain Emulation</i> which allows WAN/WLAN transmitters to accurately produce Bluetooth and ZigBee waveform.

<b>BlueBee: a 10,000x Faster Cross-Technology Communication via PHY Emulation.</b> <br>
BlueBee is a CTC technique from Bluetooth to ZigBee. This project proposes physical-layer CTC scheme in which by carefully choosing the payload for one wireless technology, e.g., Bluetooth,
the transmitter can create legitimate waveform of another wireless technology, e.g., ZigBee. Physical-layer CTC opens the door for the communications between heterogeneous
devices with high data rates.
