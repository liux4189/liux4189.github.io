## About me 

Dr. Ruofeng Liu is joining the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Michigan State University (MSU) as an assistant professor in Fall 2024. Before joining MSU, he was a research scientist at Robert Bosch. He received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Minnesota. Dr. Liu’s research broadly lies in designing intelligent sensing and wireless communication systems, with a wide range of applications in the Internet of Things, human-computer interaction, and mobile networks. He has rich experience in both academia and industry. He published 15 papers in top conferences, including NSDI, MobiCom, IJCAI, Sensys, SIGMETRICS, and UbiComp and journals such as TON, TOSN, and COMST. He was granted 4 US patents. His research innovations were adopted by several companies, including Alibaba, Nokia Bell Labs, Samsung Research, and Robert Bosch, to solve real-world problems in logistics, automotive, and telecommunications. 

## Research opportunities
2 fully-funded Research Assistants (RA) available for Spring/Fall 2026 on the following topics:

(1) Wireless sensing and localization (e.g., mmWave radar, UWB localization, Wi-Fi sensing)

(2) Embodied AI (e.g., Multimodal sensor fusion, VLM, VLA) 

(3) Mobile network (5G/6G communication, RIS)

## Projects and infrastructure
Our lab provides a variety of research platform and project opportunities for young researchers who are interested in building SW/HW systems and applying cutting-edge ML techniques to address practical problems in real-world systems.

Demos of the ongoing research projects are available at [Project](https://liux4189.github.io/projects/).

## Who should apply
I am looking for self-motivated young researchers to conduct world-class research with me. Preference will be given to people with two types of background:

(1) Interested in building SW/HW systems and experienced in signal processing, wireless communication, and embedded systems.

(2) Experienced with machine learning and interested in applying cutting-edge ML techniques to address practical problems in real-world systems. 

Publication in mobile computing conferences (e.g., MobiCom, Sensys, MobiSys, IMWUT) is a plus.
